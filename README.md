# odin-recipes
odin recipes project:
For this project I have to make 4 different pages including the index page and 3 different recipe pages. This project basically demonstrates all the main fundamental html knowledge I've learned thus far. This would include lists, headings, paragraphs, bold and italic elements, images, and links. On top of putting the html knowledge into practice I also got more of a feel for using git through the terminal.
