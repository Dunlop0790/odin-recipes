<img src="../images/grits.jpg" alt="Overhead view of a bowl of cooked grits">

<p>You probably don't know me but, this is what my usual breakfast entails: a cup of coffee and grits mixed with scrambled eggs and chicken.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 Nespresso Virtuo coffee pod</li>
    <li>4tbsp coffee creamer of choice</li>
    <li>1 packet of Quaker Instant Grits</li>
    <li>1/2cup of whole milk</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 medium chicken breasts</li>
    <li>3tbsp korean bbq sauce</li>
    <li>1tbsp sweet soy sauce</li>
    <li>4tbsp butter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing Chicken/Eggs/Grits Combo</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook Chicken</h3>
        <p>Set your stove to medium high heat and, in a medium pan, add 2tbsp of butter along with the raw chicken breast. Once fully cooked, lower pan to medium heat and shred the chicken. After shredding, add korean bbq sauce of choice and mix with the shredded chicken for a minute or so. Set chicken aside as you cook the rest and keep the pan on at medium heat for the eggs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Start Instant Grits</h3>
        <p>In a bowl, combine and stir the packet of instant grits and milk. Next, place mixture in the microwave for about 1 minute and 30 seconds. Leave in the microwave as you cook the eggs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook Scrambled Eggs</h3>
        <p>In a bowl, vigorously scramble both eggs. Next, in the same pan you cooked the chicken in, pour the eggs in and scramble. Once they're cooked most of the way through, add the sweet soy sauce and finish cooking.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Combine</h3>
        <p>Now that everything is cooked, combine and stir it all together and, your food is ready.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Preparing The Coffee</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare to Brew</h3>
        <p>Choose a Nespresso Virtuo coffee pod to use with your Nespresso Virtuo coffee machine. Once chosen, put it in the machine but don't start the brew yet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Creamer</h3>
        <p>Before pressing the button to brew, add your choice creamer to the cup. Putting in the creamer first before the coffee falls into the cup, makes the stir faster and easier</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brew and Enjoy</h3>
        <p>Press the button to brew and you'll have your coffee ready in seconds. After you have every last drop in the cup, take a spoon and stir just a couple times and you'll be good to go. Now go enjoy your coffee and protein packed grits.</p>
    </li>
